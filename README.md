# Fourier Image Mixer

A Python desktop application that allows users to mix Fourier transform components (e.g., magnitude/phase or real/imaginary) from up to four images into one, offering a powerful tool for creative and technical image manipulation.

## Features

- **Fourier Component Mixing**: Mix components (magnitude/phase or real/imaginary) from multiple images.
- **Interactive Image Management**:
  - Double-click to load images.
  - Double right-click to remove images.
- **Fourier Transform Display**: View Fourier transform components of each image based on a combobox selection.
- **Adjustable Weights**: Use sliders to control the weight of each image in the mixing operation.
- **Region Selector**: Select inner (low frequencies) or outer (high frequencies) regions of the Fourier transform for the output.
- **Real-Time Feedback**:
  - Two output viewports to display results.
  - Progress bar indicating the mixing process.
